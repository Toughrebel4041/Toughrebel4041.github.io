summary: A throwback to my lecture. Where I addressed about PPKS (Pencegahan dan Penangan Kekerasan Seksual) at Universitas Ary Ginanjar for the Freshmen
abstract: 'Building a world where everyone feels safe and comfortable is one of my biggest dreams. I’m proud to start this journey at my second home, UAG UNIVERSITY, where I’ve joined Satgas PPKS (Satuan Tugas Pencegahan dan Penanganan Kekerasan Seksual).

As part of our mission, I had the opportunity to deliver a lecture on preventing and handling sexual harassment to the incoming freshmen during UAG Welcoming Week 2024, back in August. Educating and raising awareness is essential to creating a safer environment for everyone, and I’m grateful for the chance to contribute in this mission, for a greater cause.

Dare to Act, Dare to Protect. Together, let’s fight against violence and sexual harassment. Create a safe and comfortable campus environment.'
