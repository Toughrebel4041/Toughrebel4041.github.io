    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I'm a dedicated undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Universitas Ary Ginanjar (ESQ Business School), specializing in Cybersecurity and Network Engineering. My learning sectors extend to diverse areas, including Web Development, Data Mining, AI Engineering, and Software Engineering. Proficient in Content and Copy Writing, also spend most of my free time on Bug Hunting and Cybersecurity Enthusiast Activities. I'm known for my reliability and agility in fast-paced environments. I possess a keen aptitude for learning and excel in public speaking and communication, particularly during presentations. As an exceptional team player, I also demonstrate independence with outstanding interpersonal skills.

My journey in Computer Science and Engineering began in junior high school, and I have continuously advanced my skills through courses at MITx, Coursera, and Dicoding in Computer & Software Engineering. I undertook an intensive course at MySkill, completed a basic web development bootcamp at DiCoding Academy and freeCodeCamp, and self-taught Robotic Engineering using Arduino and C language.

In addition to my technical pursuits, I have delved into diverse subjects such as Astrophysics and General Astronomy, having been part of the Olympiad Team in High School. I explored World Conflict History through HarvardX courses and acquired additional skills in writing, public speaking, basic digital marketing, and customer relationship management.

Eager to contribute my skills and knowledge, I'm actively seeking opportunities in organizations that provide challenges and room for professional growth. Feel free to connect with me, or reach out via email at raihansultanpb@gmail.com.
